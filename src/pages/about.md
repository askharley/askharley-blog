I guess this is the part where I start speaking about myself.

TL;DR:

- 24 year old software developer
- I've got a couple years of experience
- 

We all know how hard is to start something on the web, especially these days. You need to prepare a bunch of stuff, configure them and when that’s done — create the content.

This starter is pretty basic and covers all of the essentials. All you have to do is start typing!

The starter includes:

- **light/dark mode**, depending on your preferences
- great reading experience thanks to [**Inter UI font**](https://rsms.me/inter/), made by [Rasmus Andersson](https://rsms.me/about/)
- nice code highlighting thanks to [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- responsive youtube/vimeo etc. videos thanks to [**gatsby-remark-embed-video**](https://github.com/borgfriend/gatsby-remark-embed-video)

So, there you have it... enjoy!
